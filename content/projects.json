I also gained some experience in scraping for missing data in the event that the existing datasource is fragmented. The backend is a GraphQL API made using Apollo Server that connects to a MongoDB database. Through building the frontend I learned the various ways to utilize CSS in React, along with learning modern CSS patterns such as Flexbox and Grid."

This involved setting up a cloud-hosted database, writing RESTful API's hosted on AWS Lambda, and enabling user authentication via AWS Cognito. When I began this project I didn't know much about configuring cloud services like AWS so it was a great experience in learning how to read documentation effectively. "
